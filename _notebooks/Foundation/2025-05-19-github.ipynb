    "# GitHub Workflow Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the GitHub Workflow Guide. This guide introduces the main ways you'll use GitHub in your coursework — whether working alone, contributing to shared code, or collaborating in teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "To study and test code without making changes to the original repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Actions:**\n",
    "- Clone the repository to your local machine  \n",
    "- Explore code and structure  \n",
    "- Run or test locally if needed  \n",
    "- No contributions or pull requests allowed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Case:**  \n",
    "Cloning the `pages` repository to follow class lessons without modifying it.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Owner / Collaborator Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Full control over your own project or shared team repo**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "To create and maintain your own project or collaborate directly with a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Actions:**\n",
    "- Create your repository (often from a template)\n",
    "- Edit, push, and merge branches\n",
    "- Use GitHub Pages or GitHub Actions for deployment\n",
    "- Manage issues and pull requests (if collaborating)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Case:**  \n",
    "Building your personal portfolio site using a student template.\n",

    "> **Contribute to someone else’s project (like lessons or shared resources)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "To make contributions to repositories you don’t own via a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Actions:**\n",
    "1. Fork the target repository to your account  \n",
    "2. Create a new branch for your changes  \n",
    "3. Make and commit your edits  \n",
    "4. Open a pull request for review  \n",
    "5. Await merge by the repo owner\n",

    "Updating a lesson file in `pages` and submitting a pull request for review.\n",

    "## Team Project (Two Collaboration Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Work with a group to build a shared project**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: All Are Collaborators**\n",
    "- Everyone works in one shared repository\n",
    "- Direct access to push and merge code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Scrum Master + Contributors**\n",
    "- One student (Scrum Master) owns the main repo\n",
    "- Others fork, create branches, and submit pull requests\n",
    "- Scrum Master reviews and merges contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scrum Master's Role:**\n",
    "- Set up the repo (from template like `starter_flask`)\n",
    "- Merge pull requests\n",
    "- Manage issues and project settings\n",
    "- Deploy project via GitHub Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contributors' Role:**\n",
    "- Fork the main repo\n",
    "- Develop on feature branches\n",
    "- Submit pull requests for review\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Case:**  \n",
    "A team project where Emma manages the main repo and other members contribute features like login or homepage through PRs.\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Use branches for all new work**\n",
    "- Never work directly on `main`\n",
    "- Create branches like `feature/navbar` or `fix/footer-bug`\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Write clear, specific commit messages**\n",
    "- Describe what you did and why\n",
    "- Good: `Add user authentication and route protection`\n",
    "- Bad: `stuff done`\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Pull before you push**\n",
    "- Always run `git pull origin main` before pushing\n",
    "- Prevents merge conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Submit small, focused pull requests**\n",
    "- One feature or fix per PR\n",
    "- Easier to review and manage\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Use GitHub tools for coordination**\n",
    "- Issues: Track bugs or features\n",
    "- Kanban boards: Organize your sprint tasks\n",
    "- Pull Requests: Share code for review and discussion\n",
